My mother has been in care homes for the past five years.  Unfortunately the residential home that she was in, could no longer cope with her, so we had to find her a new home to cope with her worsening Alzheimers and her nursing needs.  We had an horrific experience when she was placed in a horrible home for a few weeks and we had to fight to get somewhere else.  My mother is now the happiest she has been in years and I actually look forward to seeing her with my sister Kathleen (Kangeen renamed by my daughter when she was a toddler).  We have a good laugh every week, amongst the completely mad conversation that takes place!", "tag": "ordinary", "tone": {"tone_categories": [{"category_id": "emotion_tone", "tones": [{"tone_name": "Anger", "score": 0.179992, "tone_id": "anger"}, {"tone_name": "Disgust", "score": 0.10946, "tone_id": "disgust"}, {"tone_name": "Fear", "score": 0.1508, "tone_id": "fear"}, {"tone_name": "Joy", "score": 0.613889, "tone_id": "joy"}, {"tone_name": "Sadness", "score": 0.496136, "tone_id": "sadness"}], "category_name": "Emotion Tone"}]}}, {"text": "I do not like shopping  especially for clothes.
